# Forking  

Sometimes, you may want to create a copy of a repository that you can access, even if you don't have permission to clone and make changes to it. Do you want to contribute to a repository you don't have access to? Or, do you want to create a personal copy of a repository for your own use? You can make a fork of it!

## What is Forking?

A Fork is an identical personal copy of a repository and its branches. By forking a repository, you can commit code to your version of the repository and submit a merge request to the original. Forks are able to access the object pool of the original project, allowing you to work without worry, even if you don't have access to clone the original.

## Merging changes back to the original
When you're ready to send your changes from your fork the the original repository, you can create a merge request. Set the 'Source' branch to be your forked project's branch, and set the 'Target' branch to be the branch in the original project.
