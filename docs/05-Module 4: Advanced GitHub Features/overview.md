## Module 3: Advanced GitHub Repository Features

Welcome to this module on Advanced GitHub Repository Features. In this module, we will introduce concepts such as forking projects and advanced merging techniques, among others. The purpose of these features is to allow GitHub users to work independently of their collaborators and make significant changes to their projects before coming back to merge to master. These tools help simplify collaboration, feature releases, and commit histories on large projects.  

Forking fosters experimentation and novelty, and the combination of the other three features helps users not have to worry about unmergeable differences in their code files, even when working on large projects.

- Forking a Repository
