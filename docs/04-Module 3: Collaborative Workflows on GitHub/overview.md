## Module 3: Collaborative Workflows on GitHub

Welcome to this module on collaborative workflows on GitHub. This section serves as an introduction to the essential elements
that facilitate effective teamwork and coordination within GitHub's ecosystem. GitHub Projects, Pull Requests, and Issues are
transparent tools for organizing, managing, and enhancing collaborative efforts in software development projects.

Utilizing customizable boards, teams can categorize tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor their status in real-time. This
feature streamlines the collaboration process by providing a centralized platform for project management and discussions among team
members. They enable developers to propose changes, solicit feedback, and merge code alterations into the main codebase.
Throughout this module, we will explore the functionalities and best practices associated with GitHub Projects, Pull Requests,
and Issues. By mastering these collaborative tools, teams can enhance productivity, foster innovation, and achieve project
success within the GitHub ecosystem.
