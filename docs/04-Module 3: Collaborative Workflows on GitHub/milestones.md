## Milestones in GitHub

GitHub provides a feature called **Milestones** which helps project maintainers and contributors track the progress of specific features, fixes, or other significant efforts within a larger project context.

Milestones are used to group issues and pull requests into specific goals or timelines. They are particularly useful in managing project timelines and ensuring that important objectives are met.

### How to Use Milestones

1. **Viewing Milestones**:
   - Navigate to any GitHub repository.
   - Go to the 'Issues' tab.
   - Click on 'Milestones' on the right side to see the list of milestones.

2. **Participating in Milestones**:
   - Open an issue or pull request.
   - Under the 'Milestones' dropdown menu on the right, you can assign the issue or pull request to a specific milestone.

## Following Development

Aside from milestones, you can follow the development of a project through the following methods:

### Watching a Repository
