# GitHub: Tracking Project Progress

Understanding how to track the progress of open-source projects on GitHub can enhance your ability to contribute effectively and stay updated with ongoing development.


## Milestones in GitHub

GitHub has a key feature called **milestones**. Milestones help project managers and code contributers track the progress of the codebase by providing a time-structured organization of featues, issues, and pull requests for a given project.

### Understanding Milestones

Milestones are very helpful to organize pull requests, issues, and commits into a structured timeline format. This is very beneficial for teams to use to track the status of their project tasks and goals, keeping team members accountable and on track to complete projects.

### How to Use Milestones

**Viewing Milestones**:
   - Navigate to a GitHub repository.
   - Go to the 'Issues' tab.
   - Click on 'Milestones' on the right side to see the list of milestones.

**Participating in Milestones**:
   - Open an issue or pull request in a GitHub repository.
   - Under the 'Milestones' dropdown menu on the right, assign a pull request or issue to any milestone.

## Following Development

As a non-participator or non-contributor for a given GitHub repository, you can also track development of a project by watching a repository

### Watching a Repository

- By watching a repository, you essentially subscribe to receive notifications for discussions and updates to a given repository. This is very useful to keep up-to-date with all changes and discussions. To start following a repository in this manner, click on the 'Watch' button at the top of the repository for your particular watching preference.


By subscribing to a particular repository, you will receive notifications in your GitHub inbox as shown in the following image:
