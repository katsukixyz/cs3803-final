# GitHub: Basics and Beyond

## Module 1: Introduction to Version Control

The first formal module in this e-learning course covers the basics of version control. If you aren't familiar, version control specifically refers to the act of tracking changes in software, similar to features in popular products like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and other editing software that may store and help you revert your editing history. In this module, you will dive deep into the ins and outs of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a widely-used piece of software that helps software developers around the globe manage their code changes.

> We'll help you get familiar with how to get started with Git, walking you through a series of examples and situations to make you comfortable with incorporating Git into your own projects.

By the end of the first two modules, you will be prepared to start using version control software to widen your software development repertoire, and you will be able to start using Git with your teammates and collaborators to work smoothly and effectively together. We will walk through a series of sections to introduce the concepts of version control gradually, keeping you from feeling overwhelmed.
