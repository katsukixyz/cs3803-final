# Overview of Git Training Module

Welcome to the Git Training Module! This course is designed to help you master the fundamental concepts and operations of Git, the widely used version control system. This overview will guide you through each section of the module, detailing what you will learn and how you can apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

## Contents

1. **Git Repository Structure and the Three Trees**
   - Explore the overall structure of a Git repository, including the .git directory, working directory, staging area, and commit history.
   - Learn about the three main "trees" managed by Git: the Working Directory, the Staging Index, and the Commit History.
   - Understand how Git tracks changes across these components using relevant Git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, and `git log`.
   - Watch a video tutorial on making a commit and using these commands to manage your repository.

2. **Branching in Git with Video Tutorial**
   - Delve into the concept of branching in Git, which allows for the parallel development of features, bug fixes, and experiments.
   - Discover how to effectively manage branches using `git branch` and `git checkout`, and how to merge them with `git merge`.
   - View a comprehensive video tutorial that covers the practical use of branching and merging to facilitate collaborative development efforts.
