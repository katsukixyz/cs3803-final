## Module 2: Navigating a Git Repository

Welcome to this module designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts and operations of the Git version control system. This is a brief overview of what you will learn in each section of the module, and how these skills can be applied to real world scenarios.

## Contents

1. **Git Repository Structure and the Three Trees**
   - Explore the overall structure of a Git repository, including the .git directory, working directory, staging area, and commit history.
   - Learn about the three main "trees" managed by Git: the Working Directory, the Staging Index, and the Commit History.
   - Understand how Git tracks changes across these components using relevant Git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, and `git log`.
   - Watch a video tutorial on making a commit and using these commands to manage your repository.

2. **Branching in Git**
   - Understand the concept of branching in Git, which allows for the parallel development of features, bug fixes, and experiments.
   - Discover how to effectively manage branches using `git branch` and `git checkout`, and how to merge them with `git merge`.
   - Watch a video tutorial that covers the practical use of branching and merging to implement bug fixes, test features, or work collaboratively.

### Learning Objectives

- **Comprehend Git's key mechanisms**: By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of the inner workings of Git, how it tracks changes, and how you can effecitvely view and manage the project history.
- **Practical command usage**: Get hands-on experience with crucial Git commands, enabling you to handle daily tasks in your development workflow.
- **Version control best practices**: Acquire best practices for using Git in a team setting, enhancing collaboration, and maintaining a clean project history.

### Target Audience

This module is intended for individuals new to version control, developers aiming to solidify their understanding of Git, and teams involved in software development needing robust tools for managing complex projects.
